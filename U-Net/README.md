# ee230-UNet
CS 230 project: 

U-Net implementation for building segmentation

The original code is based on https://github.com/ternaus/kaggle_dstl_submission. 

Modified to take 3-channel input and to specialize in building detection.

Fixed dependancy issues and various bugs in the original code too.
